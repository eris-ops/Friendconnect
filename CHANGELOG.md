## Migration Guides

### Migrating from v3.0 to v3.1

#### Automatic Migration
Most configurations will be automatically migrated. The bot will:
- Convert single-server configs to multi-server format
- Apply default values for new settings
- Create configuration backups
- Validate and correct common issues

#### Manual Steps (Optional)
1. **Review New Features**: Check `config.json.example` for new configuration options
2. **Enable Health Monitoring**: Configure monitoring thresholds if needed
3. **Set Up Logging**: Enable file logging for production environments
4. **Multi-Server Setup**: Add additional servers if managing multiple instances

#### Configuration Changes
```json
// Old v3.0 format (still supported)
{
  "server": "play.example.com",
  "port": 19132,
  "accounts": ["account@example.com"]
}

// New v3.1 format (recommended)
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "id": "main-server",
      "server": "play.example.com", 
      "port": 19132,
      "accounts": ["account@example.com"]
    }
  ]
}
